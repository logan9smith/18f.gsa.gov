Alla Goldman Seiffert has always been passionate about the intersection of technology and public service. Before joining 18F, she worked in national security consulting and digital strategy. She is now the deputy of the Technology Transformation Service's (TTS) Office of Acquisition, working to improve the ways the government purchases digital services. In short, her team is helping make federal procurement joyful.

Alla's love in all things tech and government drove her to spend time working for a variety of federal agencies, including the Department of State, the Executive Office of the President, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. Alla holds a law degree from the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, where she was the president of the Arizona Intellectual Property and Cyberlaw Society. 

Prior to law school, she worked as a digital strategist at a website development firm in Washington, D.C., and as an intelligence analyst at the Department of Defense.

“18F is like no other pace in the federal government,” she said. “I am very excited to work for an organizations whose mission and code of conduct I deeply identify with.”

Alla's “languages” include the ability to read and interpret laws, regulations, and policies. She’s also a fluent Russian linguist.
